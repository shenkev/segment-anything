# Kevin's notes for setting up

## Installation on the cluster

Install these things in the home folder on the nyx cluster. Skip the first 2 steps if you already have an environment with pytorch and torchvision.

```
conda create -n sam python=3.9
```

```
source activate sam
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

```
git clone git@github.com:shenkev/segment-anything.git
cd segment-anything; pip install -e .
```

```
pip install opencv-python matplotlib jupyter numpy
```

## SSHing into the GPU node and running a job

From the nyx cluster get onto the GPU machine with,

```
ssh gpu-1
```

Start a singularity container. This seems necessary or the GPU machine throws input/output errors.

```
module add singularity
export SINGULARITY_BIND="/run,/ptmp,/scratch,/tmp,/opt/ohpc,${HOME}"
singularity exec --nv /ptmp/containers/python-3.9_pytorch-1.10.0_cuda-11.3.1_latest-2023-02-22-13f58d6202a3.sif bash
```

You should now be ready to run the model. Here's an example command,

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=2 python scripts/amg.py --checkpoint checkpoints/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth --model-type vit_h --points-per-side 8 --output ./out --input images/cat.png
```

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES sets which GPUs are visible to the python script. There are 4 GPUs on the gpu-1 node.

## Viewing the output

The amg.py script saves the masks to the ./out/{image_name}.p file. The ./view_output.ipynb notebook loads this pickle file to visualize the masks. Start the jupyter notebook with,

```
jupyter notebook ./view_output.ipynb
```

Then change the paths to the original image and mask pickle file in the notebook.

## Key inference parameters

- points-per-side: [controls granularity of segmentations] The number of points to be sampled
            along one side of the image. The total number of points is
            points_per_side**2
- pred-iou-thresh: [controls number of false positives (extras) versus false negatives (misses)] A filtering threshold in [0,1], using the
            model's predicted mask quality.
- stability-score-thresh: [also false positives versus negatives] A filtering threshold in [0,1], using
            the stability of the mask under changes to the cutoff used to binarize
            the model's mask predictions.
- crop-n-layers: If >0, mask prediction will be run again on
            crops of the image. Sets the number of layers to run, where each
            layer has 2**i_layer number of image crops.
- crop-n-points-downscale-factor: The number of points-per-side
            sampled in layer n is scaled down by crop_n_points_downscale_factor**n.
- min-mask-region-area: If >0, postprocessing will be applied
            to remove disconnected regions and holes in masks with area smaller
            than min_mask_region_area. Requires opencv.

![SAM design](assets/model_diagram.png?raw=true)

The **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** produces high quality object masks from input prompts such as points or boxes, and it can be used to generate masks for all objects in an image. It has been trained on a [dataset](https://segment-anything.com/dataset/index.html) of 11 million images and 1.1 billion masks, and has strong zero-shot performance on a variety of segmentation tasks.

  <img src="assets/masks2.jpg?raw=true" width="61.5%" /> 
</p>

## Installation

The code requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Segment Anything:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

or clone the repository locally and install with

```
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
cd segment-anything; pip install -e .
```

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx
```

## <a name="GettingStarted"></a>Getting Started

First download a [model checkpoint](#model-checkpoints). Then the model can be used in just a few lines to get masks from a given prompt:

```
from segment_anything import SamPredictor, sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
predictor = SamPredictor(sam)
predictor.set_image(<your_image>)
masks, _, _ = predictor.predict(<input_prompts>)
```

or generate masks for an entire image:

```
from segment_anything import SamAutomaticMaskGenerator, sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
mask_generator = SamAutomaticMaskGenerator(sam)
masks = mask_generator.generate(<your_image>)
```

Additionally, masks can be generated for images from the command line:

```
python scripts/amg.py --checkpoint <path/to/checkpoint> --model-type <model_type> --input <image_or_folder> --output <path/to/output>
```

See the examples notebooks on [using SAM with prompts](/notebooks/predictor_example.ipynb) and [automatically generating masks](/notebooks/automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb) for more details.

  <img src="assets/notebook2.png?raw=true" width="48.9%" />
</p>

## ONNX Export

SAM's lightweight mask decoder can be exported to ONNX format so that it can be run in any environment that supports ONNX runtime, such as in-browser as showcased in the [demo](https://segment-anything.com/demo). Export the model with

```
python scripts/export_onnx_model.py --checkpoint <path/to/checkpoint> --model-type <model_type> --output <path/to/output>
```

See the [example notebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/notebooks/onnx_model_example.ipynb) for details on how to combine image preprocessing via SAM's backbone with mask prediction using the ONNX model. It is recommended to use the latest stable version of PyTorch for ONNX export.

### Web demo

The `demo/` folder has a simple one page React app which shows how to run mask prediction with the exported ONNX model in a web browser with multithreading. Please see [`demo/README.md`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/demo/README.md) for more details.

## <a name="Models"></a>Model Checkpoints

Three model versions of the model are available with different backbone sizes. These models can be instantiated by running

```
from segment_anything import sam_model_registry
sam = sam_model_registry["<model_type>"](checkpoint="<path/to/checkpoint>")
```

## Dataset

See [here](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything/) for an overview of the datastet. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads/). By downloading the datasets you agree that you have read and accepted the terms of the SA-1B Dataset Research License.

We save masks per image as a json file. It can be loaded as a dictionary in python in the below format.

```python
{
    "image"                 : image_info,
    "annotations"           : [annotation],
}

image_info {
    "image_id"              : int,              # Image id
    "width"                 : int,              # Image width
    "height"                : int,              # Image height
    "file_name"             : str,              # Image filename
}

annotation {
    "id"                    : int,              # Annotation id
    "segmentation"          : dict,             # Mask saved in COCO RLE format.
    "bbox"                  : [x, y, w, h],     # The box around the mask, in XYWH format
    "area"                  : int,              # The area in pixels of the mask
    "predicted_iou"         : float,            # The model's own prediction of the mask's quality
    "stability_score"       : float,            # A measure of the mask's quality
    "crop_box"              : [x, y, w, h],     # The crop of the image used to generate the mask, in XYWH format
    "point_coords"          : [[x, y]],         # The point coordinates input to the model to generate the mask
}
```

Image ids can be found in sa_images_ids.txt which can be downloaded using the above [link](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/segment-anything-downloads/) as well.

To decode a mask in COCO RLE format into binary:

```
from pycocotools import mask as mask_utils
mask = mask_utils.decode(annotation["segmentation"])
```

See [here](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/PythonAPI/pycocotools/mask.py) for more instructions to manipulate masks stored in RLE format.
